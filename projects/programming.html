        <p>
            Programming is one of the things I've wanted to master for forever. My first time on a scratch-course was around 4th or 5th grade. Even though, I didn't really understand it that well before we got programming-classes in 8th-grade with a teacher. Maybe was I also aiming for languages a bit too complicated for beginners...<br>

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>Python was actually my second text-based language, but it's definetly the first one that I've gotten control over. The language made me understand programming, and for the first time I felt the joy of being able to make a working program. My Python projects are not any signifficant, but can show progress in developement qualities... <br><br>(Note: Not changed to show present progress; bugs may appear)</p>

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>I've really only had three projects here; one learning HTML, a meme maker and this website. The first one isn't anything worth your time, but the meme Maker was is a cool one!</p>
