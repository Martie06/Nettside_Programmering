        <p>
            Programming is one of the things I've wanted to master for forever. My first time on a scratch-course was around 4th or 5th grade. Even though, I didn't really understand it that well before we got programming-classes in 8th-grade with a teacher. Maybe was I also aiming for languages a bit too complicated for beginners...<br>

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>Python was actually my second text-based language, but it's definetly the first one that I've gotten control over. The language made me understand programming, and for the first time I felt the joy of making a working program. Most of the projects aren't that big though so don't get your hopes to high up... </p>

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>I've really only had three projects here; one learning HTML, this website and a meme generator. The first one isn't anything worth your time, but the meme generator was quite cool!</p>
