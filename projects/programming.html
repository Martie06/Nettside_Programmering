        <p>
            Programming is one of the things I've wanted to master forever. My first time on a scratch-course was around 4th or 5th grade. Even though, I didn't really understand it that well before we got programming-classes in 8th-grade with a teacher. Maybe was I also aiming for languages a bit too complicated for beginners...<br>

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>Python was actually my second text-based language, but it's definetly the first one that I've gotten control over. The language made me understand programming, and for the first time I felt the joy of being able to make a working program. My Python projects are not any signifficant, but can show progress in developement qualities... <br><br>(Note: Not changed to show present progress; bugs may appear)</p>

        <p>I've mostly only done these in programming-classes, but I find them quite fun to do. These are mostly for learning purposes, so tutorials are followed:)</p>
