        <p>
            Sometimes I like to take a break from life, and travel to a different world; The World of Music. These compositions have either been made for own entertainment or school purposes. Enjoy!<br>

        <h2>Chill Guitar</h2>
        <p>Even after playing around in DAWs for a while, my first proper composition was complete in a school project in 7th. grade. This was an important stepping stone in my digital music achievements.
            Looking back at it now, I wouldn't call it good nor coherent, but I still find the eight first beats beautiful. And yes, you heard Crab Rave and the drop was made with help from youtube...</p>

        <h2>Sazae Summer</h2>
        <p>Another School Project, along with a <a href="../assets/music/Sazae_Summer_Score.pdf" target=”_blank”>score (in norwegian)</a> in the beginning of 9th grade. I had barely done any digital music since last 7th grade, but the progress was clear and I was impressed. At this point, I had a lot more music theoretical knowledge.
            The score got an A+, but the song itself only got a B+ because it was a bit repetitive, something I neither had time nor energy to fix.

        <h2>Fleeting Love</h2>
        <p>This one was really just for fun, or rather more like a challenge, but had two criteria: 1. One day only (which turned into one evening only because I was out with friends) and 2. Use the least possible instruments.
            I feel really embarrassed saying this, but my inspiration and will to compose this came when a girl (quite pretty) put me on read... I know. #DramaAlert lol
